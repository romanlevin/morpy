1. Model the board space. ✓
2. Model piece rules. ✓
3. Brute-force iteration over position space. ✓
4. Optimize iteration to skip symmetrical positions.
  1. Attempt iterative building fo valid positions (add
     pieces one by one ensuring the board is valid in the process). ✓
  2. Account for rotational symmetry.
  3. Memoization of attack map computation. ✓
5. Command-line interface. ✓
6. Experiment with Zobrist hashing. (zobrist branch) ✓
7. Experiment with multi-processing.
