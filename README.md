# Morpy
## A python tool for finding independent chess positions

Takes rectangular chess board dimensions and numbers of each piece type,
returns all the positions that utilize all the pieces while keeping the independent
(not threatening each other).

Morpy is named after [Paul Morphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Morphy).
